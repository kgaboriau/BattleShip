# Battle Ship

Abstract:
This was my first attempt at a JS application. In fact, this was my first real JS project. For that reason my code may look a little more like Java than JS. When building this application my first priority was to ensure all game requirements were met and that the code structure was sound with OO principles in mind. I wanted to ensure the code would be easy to refactor. Once the core functionality was in place I split my attention between UI design and application of JS principles. My attention was further divided by the fact that I was in the middle of moving between cities and my ten month old son really likes helping mommy write code. I say this not as an excuse but because I am very proud of my first JS app given the circumstances. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed writting it. Any constructive criticism is more than welcome!
