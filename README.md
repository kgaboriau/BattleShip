<b>Abstract:</b></br>
This was my first attempt at a JS application. In fact, this was my first real JS project. For that reason my code may look a little more like Java than JS. When building this application my first priority was to ensure all game requirements were met and that the code structure was sound with OO principles in mind. I wanted to ensure the code would be easy to refactor as I was learning the language on the fly. Once the core functionality was in place, I split my attention between UI design and application of JS principles. I am very proud of my first JS application and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed writting it. Below I have noted some personal reflection on my skills aquired and potential future focus for the project. Any constructive criticism is more than welcome!


<b>Assumptions Made:</b> 
- The ships cannot be rotated on the grid
- Grid size will not change (constant 8x8)

<b>New Skills Aquired:</b> 
- JS language structure
- Importing other js projects from gitHub
- Relationship between, JS, DOM, and CSS
- Using cookies


<b>If I had more time: </b>
- More focus on UI design (wanted to look into Vue.js)
- Read more about Sass
- Refactor to allow user input for player names
- Adding the ability to design the game\'s fleet would be interesting
